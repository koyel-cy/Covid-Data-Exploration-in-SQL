# COVID-19 Data Analysis

In this project, I have taken data from the source: [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The dataset was split into two Excel files, named `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations`. These files contain valuable information about location, date, total cases, new cases daily, population, and vaccination-related data.

## Data Overview

### CovidDeaths File
- Contains information about COVID-19 deaths.
- Columns: location, date, total cases, new cases, population, etc

### CovidVaccinations File
- Contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations.
- Columns: location, date, new vaccinations, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, etc.

## Data Analysis

The data was uploaded and analyzed using SQL Server. Here are some of the insights gained from the analysis:

1. **Highest Infection Rate**: Identified regions with the highest infection rates.

2. **Population vs People Vaccinated**: Explored the relationship between population and the number of vaccinated individuals.

3. **Percentage of People Infected**: Calculated the percentage of people infected in different locations.

4. **Global Numbers**: Explored global statistics, including daily death percentage and global death percentages.

5. **Death Percentage per Location**: Analyzed death percentages in different locations.

6. **Percentage of People Vaccinated per Location**: Explored the percentage of vaccinated individuals in various locations.

## Views for Readability

To enhance readability and simplify future analysis, I created several views within the SQL Server database. These views encapsulate complex queries and provide a clearer perspective on the data.

## Learnings

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into COVID-19 data analysis:
- Improved SQL skills in data manipulation and querying.
- Understanding of data relationships between infections, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Experience in creating views for better data organization and analysis.
